# [Roids](https://github.com/Fleck1337/Roids)
Asteroids Clone, College Project

This is my first project for college. It is a simple Asteroids based game made using XNA and Visual Studio 10 and 13.

The code should work fine in VS2010 with XNA or VS2013 with [MXA](http://mxa.codeplex.com). 
Other versions and and configurations may also work but have not been tested.

# Instructions

The aim of the game is to destroy the asteroids, while avoiding being hit yourself.

An enemy saucer will appear at intervals and attempt to shoot you, destroy it for points.

At any time you can use the hyperspace jump to instantly warp to another point on screen, be careful though as you may warp directly in to an asteroid!
